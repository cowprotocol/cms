# CoW CMS - Content Management System

This project is a Content Management System for the [cow.fi](https://cow.fi).

> It is an instance of Strapi, a headless CMS.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Develop

```
yarn dev
```

Some requiremets are:

- At least Node v16 (use a LTS version)
- Yarn
- PostgreSQL (optional), for local dev is easier to use sqlite3 (the default). Alternatively you can use PostgreSQL

# Dev locally using PostreSQL

The easiest is to develop using sqlite, but if you want to use PostgreSQL, you need to install it first:

- **Mac**: [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/).
- **Linux**: [PostgreSQL for Linux](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/)
- **Windows**: [PostgreSQL for Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

Once you know the running port, you can setup the .env file:

```bash
# Create an ENV file from the example
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the .env file and set the database connection

- See https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/configurations/environment

To start with the new database, you simply start the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Build the project

### Run the project from a previous build
