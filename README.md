# üë®‚Äçüíª Develop

```
yarn dev
```

Some requiremets are:

- At least Node v16 (use a LTS version)
- Yarn
- PostgreSQL (optional), for local dev is easier to use sqlite3 (the default). Alternatively you can use PostgreSQL

## Dev locally using PostreSQL

The easiest is to develop using sqlite, but if you want to use PostgreSQL, you need to install it first:

- **Mac**: [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/).
- **Linux**: [PostgreSQL for Linux](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/)
- **Windows**: [PostgreSQL for Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

Once you know the running port, you can setup the .env file:

```bash
# Create an ENV file from the example
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the .env file and set the database connection

- See https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/configurations/environment

To start with the new database, you simply start the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Build

```bash
yarn build
```

## Run project (from a previous build)

üö® For this command to work you must first have a build in place. You can do this via the previous command, `yarn build`.

```bash
yarn start
```

## üê≥ Run with Docker

```bash
# Create an ENV file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# Start the project
docker compose up
```

Then visit:

- [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin)

Also, a Postgres database will be exposed on port `5432`.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Strapi CLI

Strapi comes with a powerful CLI tooling
[Strapi documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli)

```bash
# Check version of the Strapi CLI
yarn strapi version

# Help command
yarn strapi help
```

# Library
This project also exposes a library that can be used to interact with the CMS API.

To build the library, run:

```bash
# Create a new version (patch, minor or major)
npm version minor

# Build library
yarn build:lib

# Publish to NPM
(cd lib && npm publish --access public)
```
