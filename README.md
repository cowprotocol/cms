# CoW CMS - Content Management System

This project is a Content Management System for the [cow.fi](https://cow.fi).

> It is an instance of Strapi, a headless CMS.

# API

Swagger Docs: <https://cms.cow.fi/swagger.html>

# üë®‚Äçüíª Develop

Some requiremets are:

- At least Node v16 (use a LTS version)
- Yarn
- PostgreSQL (optional), for local dev is easier to use sqlite3 (the default). Alternatively you can use PostgreSQL

## Run locally using sqlite3

The CMS relies on a database. The simplest is to use `Sqlite` for development.

You actually don't need to do anything for this! If you run the project with `yarn dev`, it will automatically create a sqlite database in `data/sqlite.db`

```
yarn dev
```

Then visit:

- **Admin**: <http://localhost:1337/admin>

On its basic setup, you don't need to add any configuration parameter, however you might want to do so. You can do this by creating a `.env` file.

```bash
# Create an ENV file from the example
cp .env.example .env
```

## Dev locally using PostreSQL

If you want to use `PostgreSQL` (instead of `sqlite3`), you need to install it first:

- **Mac**: [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/).
- **Linux**: [PostgreSQL for Linux](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/)
- **Windows**: [PostgreSQL for Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

Once you know the running port, you can setup the .env file:

```bash
# Create an ENV file from the example
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the .env file and set the database connection

- See <https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/configurations/environment>

To start with the new database, you simply start the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Build

Before running the server for the first time, you need to build it:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Run project (from a previous build)

üö® For this command to work you must first have a build in place. You can do this via the previous command, `yarn build`.

```bash
yarn start
```

## üê≥ Run with Docker

```bash
# Create an ENV file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# Start the project
docker compose up
```

Then visit:

- [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin)

Also, a Postgres database will be exposed on port `5432`.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Strapi CLI

Strapi comes with a powerful CLI tooling
[Strapi documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli)

```bash
# Check version of the Strapi CLI
yarn strapi version

# Help command
yarn strapi help
```

# Library

This project also exposes a library that can be used to interact with the CMS API.

To build the library, run:

```bash
# Create a new version (patch, minor or major)
npm version minor

# Build and Publish to NPM
./scripts/publish-lib.sh
```
